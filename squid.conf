#       WELCOME TO SQUID 3.5.27
#       ----------------------------
#       
#       This is the documentation for the Squid configuration file.
#       This documentation can also be found online at:
#               http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/
#       
#       You may wish to look at the Squid home page and wiki for the
#       FAQ and other documentation:
#               http://www.squid-cache.org/
#               http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq
#               http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples
#       
#       This documentation shows what the defaults for various directives
#       happen to be.  If you don't need to change the default, you should
#       leave the line out of your squid.conf in most cases.
#       
#       In some cases "none" refers to no default setting at all,
#       while in other cases it refers to the value of the option
#       - the comments for that keyword indicate if this is the case.
#
#  Configuration options can be included using the "include" directive.
#  Include takes a list of files to include. Quoting and wildcards are
#  supported.
#
#  For example,
#
#  include /path/to/included/file/squid.acl.config
#
#  Includes can be nested up to a hard-coded depth of 16 levels.
#  This arbitrary restriction is to prevent recursive include references
#  from causing Squid entering an infinite loop whilst trying to load
#  configuration files.
#
#  Values with byte units
#
#       Squid accepts size units on some size related directives. All
#       such directives are documented with a default value displaying
#       a unit.
